🟣 1️⃣ Introduction

Good morning everyone,

Today I’m presenting my platform, which is inspired by apps like Tango, but with a major difference:
It does not allow live streaming.

Instead, it focuses entirely on short-form video content, reels, and premium media posts.

The goal of this platform is to create a high-engagement, content-first experience, where users can watch, interact, and support creators — without live broadcasting.

🟣 2️⃣ The Problem

Many platforms today rely heavily on live streaming. However:

Live streaming requires high bandwidth

It increases moderation complexity

It creates unpredictable content risks

It can be technically expensive to maintain

So I asked:

What if we build a platform that keeps the engagement and monetization features — but removes live streaming?

That’s what this platform does.

🟣 3️⃣ The Solution

My platform is a reels-based content platform.

Instead of live streams, users interact with:

Short videos

Reels

Clips

Premium posts

The experience is optimized for:

Mobile-first usage

Infinite scrolling

Quick engagement

Monetization through virtual coins

It combines the scrolling behavior of short-video apps with the engagement and gifting system inspired by platforms like Tango.

🟣 4️⃣ How the Platform Works
🔐 Step 1: Authentication

Users must create an account using:

Email

Username

Password

This ensures:

Verified users

Content protection

Controlled access

After email verification, users enter the platform.

📱 Step 2: The Main Feed

When users log in, they see:

A dark, premium interface

A scrolling feed of reels

Auto-playing short videos

Creator information

Each reel has:

Like button ❤️

Tip button 💰

Save / favorite option

Share option

The design is modern, dark-themed, and minimal to keep focus on content.

🔍 Step 3: Discover & Trending

Users can:

Search creators

Browse by tags

Explore trending reels

View recommended content

The recommendation system tracks:

Watch time

Likes

Favorites

Interaction patterns

This creates a personalized experience.

💰 Step 4: Monetization System

Instead of live gifts during streams, monetization works through:

Virtual coins

Tips on individual reels

Creator support system

Reward points

Users can:

Buy coins

Earn coins through engagement

Tip creators directly

This makes the system controlled and scalable.

🟣 5️⃣ Technical Architecture

The platform is built using modern technologies:

Next.js – for fast frontend rendering

Tailwind CSS – for styling

Zustand – for state management

TanStack Query – for data fetching

Firebase / Supabase – for authentication and database
